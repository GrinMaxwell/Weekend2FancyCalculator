# Weekend 2 Fancy Calculator

### Assignment: Build a fully functional calculator

#### Notes
1. Build order
  1. First I set up the html
  2. then the basic CSS (using neat to make it all fit nice)
  3. then the basic Javascript
    - I started an identical project in the crash course a few weeks ago and so I specifically do not want to look at the code from before so I have to force myself to logically process each step and build it one piece at a time, understanding each piece fully
    - as such, it is hardly elegant or concise code
    - but now is the time to fully master the basics before attempting things higher ideals like elegance or concision
